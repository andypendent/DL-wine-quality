## The Mission

Wine tasting has been around since the creation of wine itself. However, in the modern era, more importance has been given to drinking a _good_ wine, e.g. a french _Bordeaux_.
France has always been hailed as the _land of the wine_.
However, during the [Judgment of Paris](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_(wine)>) in 1976, a Californian wine scored better than a french wine which led to the increase in popularity of Californian wine.

Moreover, it has been shown that there are [many biases in wine tasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_wine_tasting).

That is why we put together this project to let an AI predict the quality of a wine.
